## IDEA Configurations
1. Open `Question1` folder as an IDEA project.

   This creates a `.idea` folder and `Question1.iml` file under `Question1`.
   
   Also, check "Use module compile output path" for `Question1` in project structure.

2. Import `Question1` as a module into the root repository.

   Otherwise, Java files under `Quesiton1` are not runnable (IDEA won't give run buttons)
   when opening the root repository (unlike opening just `Question1` itself).
