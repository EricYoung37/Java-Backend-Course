# HW4 - Question 25

## IDEA Configurations
1. Open `Question25` folder as an IDEA project.

   This creates a `.idea` folder and `Question25.iml` file under `Question25`.

   Also, check "Use module compile output path" for `Question25` in project structure.

   Git is enabled by the parent project. **Don't** use Git for this module.

2. Import `Question25` as a module into the root repository.

   Otherwise, Java files under `Question25` are not runnable (IDEA won't give run buttons)
   when opening the root repository (unlike opening just `Question25` itself).
