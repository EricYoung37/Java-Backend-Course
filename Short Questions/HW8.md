## Question 5
> What is HikariCP?
> 
> Benefits of connection pools

HikariCP is a high-performance **JDBC connection pool library** for Java applications.

| Benefit                                        | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Improved Performance**                       | Reduces overhead by reusing existing connections, leading to faster response times.                                                          |
| **Efficient Resource & Connection Management** | Manages limited connections, automatically validates, and replaces faulty connections, ensuring optimal usage and freeing up idle resources. |
| **Scalability**                                | Can scale to handle large numbers of simultaneous database requests.                                                                         |
| **Reliability**                                | Provides automatic recovery from failures and ensures better fault tolerance.                                                                |
| **Thread Management**                          | Optimizes resource sharing and synchronization between threads.                                                                              |
