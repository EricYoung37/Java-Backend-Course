See [Spring-Boot-Annotations.md](Spring-Boot-Annotations.md).


## Question 2
> - Monolithic Architecture
> - Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
> - Microservices Architecture

### Monolithic Architecture
A traditional model where an entire application is built as **a single, unified unit**.

**Example:** A small online bookstore integrates product listings, user login, checkout, and payment processing into a single application that is deployed as one unit.

### Service-Oriented Architecture
An architectural pattern where an application is **composed of multiple services** that communicate over a network using standard protocols (e.g., SOAP, HTTP).

**Example:** A large bank integrates its Customer Management, Loan Processing, and Fraud Detection systems as reusable enterprise services, communicating via an Enterprise Service Bus, where the Customer Management service handles all customer-related operations at **a high level**.

### Microservices Architecture
A variant of SOA that structures an application as a collection of **small, independently deployable services**, each focused on a **specific business function**.

**Example:** An e-commerce platform **breaks down customer-related functionality into granular services** like Customer Registration, Profile Management, and Order History, each deployed independently and maintained by different teams.


## Question 3
> Core Components of Microservices Architecture

### API Gateway
- Centralized **entry point** for clients.
- Handles **request routing**, **protocol translation**, **load balancing**, **authentication**, and **rate limiting**.

### Load Balancer
- Distributes incoming traffic **across service instances**.
- Enhances availability, fault tolerance, and performance.

### Authentication and Authorization
- Verifies **identity** and manages **access control**.
- Ensures secure communication between clients and services.
- Common protocols: **OAuth2**, **JWT**, **OpenID Connect**.

### Services
- Independently deployable units encapsulating **specific business capabilities**.
- Loosely coupled and communicate over lightweight protocols (HTTP/REST, gRPC, messaging).

### Inter-Service Communication
- Mechanisms by which microservices interact.
    - **Synchronous**: **REST**, gRPC
    - **Asynchronous**: Messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ, **Apache Kafka**)

### Service Registry and Discovery
- Maintains a **directory of available services** and their instances.
- Enables services to discover each other dynamically.
- Tools: Eureka, Consul, **Zookeeper**.

### Configuration Management
- Centralized management of configuration data for services.
- Supports dynamic updates and consistency across environments.
- Tools: Spring Cloud Config, Consul KV.

### Service Mesh
- **Manages service-to-service communication** at the infrastructure level.
- Adds traffic control, observability, retries, timeouts, and security without modifying service code.
- Examples: Istio, Linkerd.

### Monitoring and Logging
- Provides visibility into system health, performance, and issues.
    - **Monitoring**: **Prometheus**
    - **Visualization**: **Grafana**
    - **Logging**: **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
    - **Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin

### Data Management
- Each service owns its own database (Database-per-Service pattern).
- Prevents tight coupling and allows schema independence.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automates** code **integration**, **testing**, and **deployment**.
- Ensures consistent and reliable delivery of services.
- Tools: **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, **Argo CD**, **Spinnaker**.

### Containerization and Orchestration
- Services are packaged as **containers** (e.g., with **Docker**).
- Orchestrated by platforms like **Kubernetes** to manage scaling, availability, and deployment.


## Question 4
> Resilience Patterns
> - Circuit Breaker Example

Resilience patterns are architectural and design strategies used in software systems to ensure that applications can **withstand**, **recover from**, and **adapt to failures**,
whether they stem from **internal faults** or **external conditions**.

<details>
<summary>Common Patterns</summary>

| **Pattern**         | **Purpose**                                      | **Typical Use Case**                                 | **Cautions / Considerations**                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retry**           | Re-attempt failed operations                     | Temporary network glitches, timeouts                 | Use exponential backoff; avoid retry storms                 |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Prevent repeated attempts during failure         | Remote service instability, dependent service outage | Tune thresholds carefully to balance failure vs. recovery   |
| **Bulkhead**        | Isolate components to prevent cascading failures | Service with multiple consumers or dependencies      | Requires resource partitioning (e.g., thread pools)         |
| **Timeout**         | Limit wait time for operations                   | Long-running or unreliable services                  | Must be shorter than client timeout; avoid setting too low  |
| **Fallback**        | Provide alternative response or logic on failure | Cached data, default values, graceful degradation    | Ensure fallbacks are meaningful and do not mask real issues |
| **Rate Limiting**   | Control request rate to prevent overload         | Public APIs, traffic spikes                          | Implement fair usage policies; may impact user experience   |
| **Fail Fast**       | Immediately reject problematic operations        | Pre-checks, misconfigured requests                   | Prevents waste of resources; ensure checks are lightweight  |
| **Load Shedding**   | Reject excess traffic to maintain system health  | Sudden traffic bursts, high CPU/memory usage         | Must prioritize critical requests; risk of user rejection   |
| **Steady State**    | Detect when the system is operating normally     | Monitoring, health checks, auto-scaling decisions    | Requires well-defined metrics and baselines                 |
</details>

### Circuit Breaker Example

The Circuit Breaker pattern in Spring Cloud can be implemented using Hystrix, a fault tolerance library originally developed by Netflix, but **now in maintenance mode**.

<details>
<summary>Implementation</summary>

**◾ Add Dependencies**

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<!--set proper Spring Cloud version-->
<dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
        <version>Hoxton.SR12</version> <!-- or other stable version -->
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

**◾ Optional `application.properties` Configuration**

```properties
# Hystrix timeout (optional tuning)
hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=2000
```

**◾ Enable Hystrix in the Application**

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.circuitbreaker.EnableCircuitBreaker;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCircuitBreaker
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

**◾ Use `@HystrixCommand` in a Service Layer**

```java
import com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.javanica.annotation.HystrixCommand;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class UserService {

    @HystrixCommand(
            fallbackMethod = "getDefaultUser",
            circuitBreakerEnabled = true,  // Enable the circuit breaker
            circuitBreakerRequestVolumeThreshold = 10,  // Minimum number of requests before circuit breaker is considered
            circuitBreakerErrorThresholdPercentage = 50,  // Error threshold percentage for the circuit to open
            circuitBreakerSleepWindowInMilliseconds = 5000  // Time to wait before trying again when in Half-Open state
    )
    public String getUserDetails(String userId) {
        // Simulating a remote service call
        // This may fail to trigger the circuit breaker
        return "User " + userId;
    }

    public String getDefaultUser(String userId) {
        return "Default User (Service unavailable)";
    }
}
```
</details>

#### Flow of Circuit Breaker States
- **Closed State**:
  - Requests are processed **normally**.
  - If a failure rate crosses the `circuitBreakerErrorThresholdPercentage` threshold (e.g., 50%), the circuit breaker transitions to **Open**.


- **Open State**:
  - Requests are **immediately rejected and fallback** is triggered.
  - After the `circuitBreakerSleepWindowInMilliseconds` period (e.g., 5000 ms), the circuit breaker enters the **Half-Open** state.


- **Half-Open State**:
  - A few requests (as configured by `circuitBreakerRequestVolumeThreshold`) are allowed to pass through.
  - If successful, the circuit breaker transitions back to **Closed**. If the requests fail, it returns to **Open**.


## Question 5
> Load Balancing Algorithms

| **Algorithm**            | **Description**                                                    | **Best Use Case**                       | **Considerations**                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Round Robin**          | Distributes requests sequentially in a cyclic manner               | Equal server capacity                   | Ignores server load                 |
| **Weighted Round Robin** | Uses server weights to distribute more traffic to stronger servers | Varying server capabilities             | Requires pre-defined weights        |
| **Least Connections**    | Chooses the server with the fewest active connections              | Varying connection durations            | Tracks connection state             |
| **Weighted Least Conn.** | Least connections with server capacity weights                     | Mixed server performance + varying load | Complex configuration               |
| **IP Hash**              | Uses a hash of client IP for server selection                      | Session persistence required            | Sensitive to changes in server pool |
| **Random**               | Selects a server at random                                         | Uniform, simple workloads               | May lead to uneven distribution     |
| **Least Response Time**  | Chooses server with fastest average response time                  | Performance-critical, real-time systems | Requires real-time monitoring       |


## Question 6
> API Gateway

An API Gateway is **a server** that acts as an intermediary **between clients and backend services** (such as microservices or databases).
It serves as **a single entry point** for all client requests and performs various functions such as **request routing**, **protocol translation**, **load balancing**, **authentication**, and **rate limiting**.

**Benefits:**
- **Simplifies** client **interaction** by aggregating multiple services behind a single endpoint.
- Enhances **security** through centralized access control.
- Improves **scalability** and **fault isolation** in microservices architecture.

Examples:
- **AWS API Gateway**
- **NGINX**
- Kong
- Apigee
- Zuul (Spring Cloud Gateway)


## Question 7
> Service Registry & Service Discovery

Service registry and service discovery are **complementary** components, not opposing approaches.
They work together to enable dynamic and reliable communication between services in a microservices architecture.

### Service Registry
A service registry is a centralized database or server that maintains a list of all available services and their instances. Each service, upon startup, registers itself with the registry by providing information such as
- Service name
- IP address
- Port number
- Health status (optional)

Examples of service registries:
- **Zookeeper** (by Apache)
- Eureka (from Netflix)
- Consul (by HashiCorp)


### Service Discovery
Service discovery is the process by which a client or another service locates the address of a service it wants to communicate with. It works in two common modes:

**Client-side discovery:**
- **The client queries the service registry** to get the location of a service instance.
- The client uses a load balancer (e.g., Ribbon) to select one instance from the list.

**Server-side discovery:**
- The client sends a request to a discovery-aware load balancer or gateway (e.g., AWS ELB or Zuul).
- **The server queries the registry**, selects a service instance, and forwards the request.
