|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Unit**            | method, class                 |
| **Integration**     | module interactions           |
| **Functional**      | functional requirements       |
| **Regression**      | code change, rerun            |
| **Smoke Test**      | broad, shallow                |
| **Performance**     | expected workload             |
| **Stress**          | overload                      |
| **End to End**      | QA, system, functionality     |
| **User Acceptance** | system, business requirements |

#### Unit Testing
- Testing **individual** components (usually **methods** or **classes**) in isolation.
- **Frameworks**: JUnit, Mockito, TestNG
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @SpringBootTest
    class CalculatorServiceTest {
    
        @Autowired
        private CalculatorService calculatorService;
    
        @Test
        void testAddition() {
            assertEquals(5, calculatorService.add(2, 3));
        }
    }
    ```

#### Integration Testing
- Testing the interaction **between multiple** components or modules.
- **Frameworks**: TestNG
- **Example**:
    ```java
    @SpringBootTest
    @AutoConfigureTestDatabase
    class UserRepositoryIntegrationTest {
    
        @Autowired
        private UserRepository userRepository;
    
        @Test
        void testSaveAndRetrieveUser() {
            User user = new User("John", "Doe");
            userRepository.save(user);
    
            Optional<User> found = userRepository.findById(user.getId());
            assertTrue(found.isPresent());
        }
    }
    ```

#### Functional Testing
- Tests the **system** against **functional requirements**, focusing on what the system does.

- **Example**: Using Postman to test the REST API endpoints of a Spring Boot app.

#### Regression Testing
- **Re-run previously run tests** to verify that **new code** changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities.

- **Example**: After modifying a login method, **rerun** the full suite of tests to ensure login and other features are still functional.

#### Smoke Testing
- A.k.a., **build verification test**.
A **preliminary** (broad but shallow) test that checks the basic functionality of an application to determine whether it is stable enough for further testing.
Often part of the **CI/CD** pipeline.

- **Frameworks**: JUnit / TestNG (backend), Selenium (browser automation), Postman (API), Jenkins / GitHub Actions (CI)
- **Example**: After deploying the Spring Boot application in the CI pipeline, run a smoke test that sends a `GET` request to `/actuator/health` and expects an HTTP 200 response to confirm the app is up and responsive.

#### Performance Testing
- Measures how a system behaves under **expected workloads**.
- **Frameworks**: JMeter, k6, Gatling
- **Example**: Using JMeter to simulate 100 **concurrent users** accessing `/api/products`.

#### Stress Testing
- A **form of performance testing** that evaluates system behavior under **extreme conditions**.
- **Frameworks**: JMeter, k6, Gatling
- **Example**: **Continuously increase the request rate** on a Spring Boot API **until it starts returning 5xx errors**.

#### A/B Testing
- A comparative testing method where **two versions** (A and B) of a webpage or feature are **shown** to different user groups to determine which performs better based on **specific metrics**.

- **Example**: Route 50% of users to `/homepageA` and 50% to `/homepageB`, then compare conversion metrics.

#### End-to-End Testing
- Tests the **complete workflow** of an application from **start to finish**.

- **Example**: Automating a user registration flow in a Spring Boot app **from UI interaction to DB verification**.

#### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Validation of system functionality **by the end user or client** to ensure it meets business requirements.

- **Example**: Client tests a Spring Boot-based booking system on the [staging](#pre-prodstaging) environment to approve the feature.


### Environment Related

#### Development
- Primary environment for active code development.
- Spring Boot: Typically uses `dev` profile.
    ```properties
    spring.profiles.active=dev
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
    spring.datasource.username=sa
    spring.datasource.password=
    ```

#### QA
- An environment dedicated to **comprehensive testing activities** such as [functional](#functional-testing), [integration](#integration-testing), and [regression testing](#regression-testing).
It simulates real-world scenarios to catch defects **before further deployment**.
- Spring Boot: Might use a `qa` profile for testing.

#### Pre-Prod/Staging
- A **near-replica of the production environment** used for final validation, including [UAT](#user-acceptance-testing-uat) and [performance testing](#performance-testing).
It serves as the last checkpoint before release to production.
- Example: Spring Boot app **connected to** the same type of DB and services as **production**.

#### Production
- Live environment used by actual users.
- Spring Boot: Typically uses `prod` profile with real databases and credentials.
    ```properties
    spring.profiles.active=prod
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://prod-db:3306/app
    spring.datasource.username=prod_user
    spring.datasource.password=
    ```

## Question 3
> Sprint Routine

- 1 to 4 weeks (commonly 2 weeks)
- Sprint planning: select tasks and user stories from the backlog (1st day)
- Sprint Review: demo completed work (last day)
- Sprint Retrospective: reflection — discuss what went well and what can improve for the next Sprint (last day)
